# Bootstrap Code Samples
Using responsive web design techniques, developers can build websites that automatically reflect each userâ€™s device size, screen resolution, and other aspects of their viewing experience.

Developed by Twitter, the Bootstrap framework does all that for them, making responsive design easy and viable for millions of sites that could have never considered it before.
